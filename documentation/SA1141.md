:memo: This rule is new for StyleCop Analyzers, and was not present in StyleCop Classic.

## Cause

A tuple is declared using the `ValueTuple<>` syntax rather than the tuple syntax.

## Rule description

This rule reports diagnostics for three cases when supported by the language version of the project:

1. Prefer `(T1, T2)` to `ValueTuple<T1, T2>`
1. Prefer `(value1, value2)` to `ValueTuple.Create(value1, value2)`
1. Prefer `(value1, value2)` to `new ValueTuple<T1, T2>(value1, value2)`

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the code to use the new C# tuple syntax when applicable.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.ReadabilityRules", "SA1141:UseTupleSyntax", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1141 // Use tuple syntax
#pragma warning restore SA1141 // Use tuple syntax
```
