:memo: This rule is new for StyleCop Analyzers, and was not present in StyleCop Classic.

## Cause

A tuple element is referenced via the underlying field instead of the provided element name.

## Rule description

This rule reports a diagnostic when a tuple element is referenced by the underlying field name instead of the provided element name.

```csharp
(int x, int y) point = (1, 2);
Console.WriteLine(point.x);     // OK
Console.WriteLine(point.Item1); // SA1142
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the code to reference the tuple element by name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.ReadabilityRules", "SA1142:ReferenceTupleElementsByName", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1142 // Reference tuple elements by name
#pragma warning restore SA1142 // Reference tuple elements by name
```
