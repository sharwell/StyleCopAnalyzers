:memo: This rule is new for StyleCop Analyzers, and was not present in StyleCop Classic.

## Cause

A tuple element in a type or member signature contains one or more unnamed elements.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a tuple type in a type or member signature contains one or more unnamed elements.

```csharp
(MyService, int y) Method1();         // SA1414
(MyService service, int y) Method2(); // OK
```

This diagnostic is only reported for original definitions. See also [SA1415](SA1415.md).

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, provide explicit names for tuple elements appearing in type and member signatures.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.MaintainabilityRules", "SA1414:NameTupleElementsInSignatures", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1414 // Name tuple elements in signatures
#pragma warning restore SA1414 // Name tuple elements in signatures
```
