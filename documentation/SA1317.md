:memo: This rule is new for StyleCop Analyzers, and was not present in StyleCop Classic.

## Cause

A tuple type appearing in the signature of an overriding or implementing type or member contains an element whose name
does not match the name of the corresponding tuple element in the original definition.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a tuple type appearing in the signature of an overriding or implementing type or
member contains an element whose name does not match the name of the corresponding tuple element in the original
definition.

```csharp
interface MyInterface {
  (int, int) GetPoint();
  (int x, int y) GetOrigin();
}

class MyClass : MyInterface {
  public (int x, int y) GetPoint() => (0, 0);            // OK
  pubilc (int x, int anotherName) GetOrigin() => (0, 0); // SA1317
}
```

This diagnostic is not reported if the corresponding tuple element in the original definition is not named.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, provide explicit names for tuple elements appearing in type and member signatures.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.NamingRules", "SA1317:TupleElementsShouldMatchInheritedNames", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1317 // Tuple elements should match inherited names
#pragma warning restore SA1317 // Tuple elements should match inherited names
```
